# APIs

## Passport.js (google/facebook APIs)

Passport.js interfaces with google and facebook auth apis to allow users to sign in via existing social accounts

## Udemy API

https://www.udemy.com/developers/affiliate/models/user/

"The Udemy Affiliate API exposes a lot of functionalities of Udemy to help developers build client applications and integrations with Udemy.
<br>
<br>
It is organized around REST. Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. We only accept https calls to the API. All responses will be returned in JSON format, including errors. OAuth 2 protocol is used for user authorization (not documented yet).
<br>
<br>
Udemy Affiliate API is currently at version 2.0 and the root endpoint is https://www.udemy.com/api-2.0/ for all resources."

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  REACT_APP_MIXPANEL - Mixpanel token used for tracking user actions
